A repository to contain all my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Problems.

I started with Python in 2021 and did 1-16 and maybe others.
Since then, I have started redoing those problems in C to get acquainted with the language.
As of September 2023, I have caught up to where I was in Python and solved more problems in C than in Python.
